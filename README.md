# safebank

This project basically focuses on Secure Coding/Development Process:-
Safe Bank is a basic application of an online banking system with the following features:
  a)	Sign In
  b)	Sign UP with email verification .
  c)	Account Summary.
  d)	Update Password.
  e)	Transfer Money.
  f)	Add Payee.
  g)	Fudn Transfer History.
  h)	Make a donation.
  i)	Bank Customer Care portal.
Tech Stack :
  a)	Java SpringBoot Application for the REST endpoints.
  b)	HTML/CSS and javascript to display the portal and consume the APIs.
  c)	H2 as in memory database .
We have intentionally left few security/technical flaws in application . This is just to demo the target enthusiast developers the common security vulnerabilities that we might have in our code during a casual coding process.
We will be pushing another repo with all steps to mitigate these flaws.
Please Note :
  a)	There might be several other security/technical flaws in the application , but we are mainly aiming to enlighten the very common flaws that a developer skips to address . 
  b)	There might be many other ways to resolve these issues . We have just tried to solve it by one of the way .

We would really love to have contributions from various other minds , so that we can make this application focus on more vulnerabilities.
